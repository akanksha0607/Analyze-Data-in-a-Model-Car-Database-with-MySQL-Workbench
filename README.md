# Project Senario:
Mint Classics Company, a renowned retailer specializing in classic model cars and vehicles, faces a significant challenge. They are contemplating the closure of one of their storage facilities, and this decision hinges on a thorough data analysis. The primary aim is to optimize inventory while ensuring prompt and efficient customer service – a critical factor for the company.

As a data analyst, you play a pivotal role in this venture. Your mission is to leverage MySQL Workbench to delve into the business's intricacies by meticulously examining the existing data. You will work with a designated data model and sample data tables, meticulously identifying the aspects of the data that can contribute to informed decisions about inventory reduction.

Key Responsibilities :
-->Warehouse Optimization: Where are items currently stored, and could rearranging them lead to the elimination of an entire warehouse?
-->Sales and Inventory Relationship: How do inventory numbers correlate with sales figures, and do the current inventory counts align with the requirements for each product?
-->Inventory Efficiency: Are certain items stagnant in storage, raising the question of whether they should be discontinued from the product line?

# Project Objectives:

1. Explore products currently in inventory.

2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.

3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
--> Profit Margin Ratio:
Profit Margin is a financial metric that assesses the profitability of a business or product. It measures the percentage of profit earned in relation to total revenue. The formula to calculate profit margin is:

Profit Margin (%) = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) x 100

where:
Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Revenue = (Quantity Sold * Price per Unit)

--> Year-over-Year Vehicle Sales Growth Rate :
The relative change in the number of vehicles sold by a company or in a specific market between one year and the previous year. A positive growth rate signifies an increase in sales, while a negative rate indicates a decrease.
The Year-over-Year Vehicle Sales Growth Rate formula:

Year-over-Year Growth Rate (%) = ((Vehicle Sales in Current Year−Vehicle Sales in Previous Year)*100) / (Vehicle Sales in Previous Year) 
​
Where:
Vehicle Sales in Current Year: The total number of vehicles sold in the current year.
Vehicle Sales in Previous Year: The total number of vehicles sold in the previous year.

--> Sales-to-Initial Stock Percentage : 
The proportion of initial stock that has been sold as a percentage of the total initial stock. It provides insights into how efficiently a business is managing its inventory and how quickly products are being sold.
Sales-to-Initial Stock Percentage Formula:

Sales-to-Initial Stock Percentage (%) = (Quantity Sold/Initial Stock) * 100
​
Where:
Quantity Sold: The total number of items or products sold during the specified time period.
Initial Stock: The total quantity of items or products available in the inventory at the beginning of the same time period.

--> Inventory Composition Percentage :
Inventory Composition Percentage is a metric that provides the percentage representation of a specific category, type, or location of inventory within the entire inventory. It helps assess the relative weight of a particular subset of inventory.
Inventory Composition Percentage Formula:

Inventory Composition Percentage (%) = (Quantity of Specific Inventory / Total Inventory Quantity)*100 

Where:
Quantity of Specific Inventory: The total quantity of a specific type, category, or location of inventory.
Total Inventory Quantity: The overall quantity of all inventory, including the specific category or location.

--> Total Sales Revenue :
Total Sales Revenue is the sum of all the money a business has earned from selling its products.
Total Sales Revenue Formula:

Total Sales Revenue = Total Quantity Sold × Selling Price per Unit

Where:
Total Quantity Sold: The sum of all units of products or services sold.
Selling Price per Unit: The price at which each unit is sold.
