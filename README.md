# Project Senario:
Mint Classics Company, a renowned retailer specializing in classic model cars and vehicles, faces a significant challenge. They are contemplating the closure of one of their storage facilities, and this decision hinges on a thorough data analysis. The primary aim is to optimize inventory while ensuring prompt and efficient customer service – a critical factor for the company.

As a data analyst, you play a pivotal role in this venture. Your mission is to leverage MySQL Workbench to delve into the business's intricacies by meticulously examining the existing data. You will work with a designated data model and sample data tables, meticulously identifying the aspects of the data that can contribute to informed decisions about inventory reduction.

Key Responsibilities :
-->Warehouse Optimization: Where are items currently stored, and could rearranging them lead to the elimination of an entire warehouse?
-->Sales and Inventory Relationship: How do inventory numbers correlate with sales figures, and do the current inventory counts align with the requirements for each product?
-->Inventory Efficiency: Are certain items stagnant in storage, raising the question of whether they should be discontinued from the product line?

# Project Objectives:

1. Explore products currently in inventory.

2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.

3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

# Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
--> Profit Margin Ratio:
Profit Margin is a financial metric that assesses the profitability of a business or product. It measures the percentage of profit earned in relation to total revenue. The formula to calculate profit margin is:

Profit Margin (%) = (Gross Profit / Total Revenue) x 100

where:
Gross Profit = Revenue - Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
Revenue = (Quantity Sold * Price per Unit)

-->Year-over-Year Vehicle Sales Growth Rate :
the relative change in the number of vehicles sold by a company or in a specific market between one year and the previous year. A positive growth rate signifies an increase in sales, while a negative rate indicates a decrease.
The Year-over-Year Vehicle Sales Growth Rate  is calculated using the following formula:

Year-over-Year Growth Rate (%) = ((Vehicle Sales in Current Year−Vehicle Sales in Previous Year)*100) / Vehicle Sales in Previous Year 
​
Where:
Vehicle Sales in Current Year: The total number of vehicles sold in the current year.
Vehicle Sales in Previous Year: The total number of vehicles sold in the previous year.
